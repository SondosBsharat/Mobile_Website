First, ensure the dishes are loaded in a manner that does not obstruct the drying fan, as this can lead to inadequate cleaning. Check that the spray arms are not damaged or missing, which can prevent water from reaching the dishes effectively. Make sure the water supply is consistent and that the water inlet valve is not partially closed, as this can impact performance. Verify that the detergent is the correct type for your dishwasher model and that the dispenser isn't jammed. For leaks, inspect the door seal for any punctures or misalignment that may prevent it from sealing effectively. Additionally, ensure the drain hose is securely connected and free of bends that might cause leaks. Running a cleaning cycle with a high-efficiency cleaner can also help remove stubborn buildup. If issues persist, reviewing the user manual for advanced troubleshooting or seeking professional repair advice might be necessary.</li>
                                <li class="correct">c)If your dishwasher is not cleaning dishes properly and is occasionally leaking despite confirming proper installation, there are several issues to consider. First, ensure the dishwasher is loaded correctly, with dishes not blocking the spray arms. Check that the spray arms are not clogged with debris, which can prevent water from reaching the dishes. Make sure the water supply is adequate; the water inlet valve should be fully open, and the water pressure should meet the dishwasher's specifications. Also, verify that the detergent you're using is appropriate and not expired, and that the detergent dispenser is functioning correctly. For leaks, inspect the door seal for damage or debris that may prevent it from sealing properly. Additionally, check the dishwasher's drain hose and connections for leaks or clogs. Running a cleaning cycle with a dishwasher cleaner can also help remove any buildup that might be affecting performance. If problems persist, consider consulting the dishwasher's manual for specific troubleshooting tips or contacting a professional for repair.</li>
                            <li>d) If your dishwasher is not performing well at cleaning dishes and occasionally leaks despite confirming that it is installed correctly, several aspects should be examined. First, load the dishwasher ensuring that dishes do not interfere with the drying elements, as this can compromise cleaning efficiency. Verify that the spray arms are not obstructed by utensils, which can block water from reaching the dishes. Ensure the water supply is stable and that the water inlet valve is not faulty, meeting the dishwasher's specifications for water pressure. Check that the detergent isn't the wrong type for your specific dishwasher brand and that the dispensing unit is not malfunctioning. For leaks, examine the door seal for any signs of hardening or deformation that might prevent it from sealing properly. Additionally, inspect the dishwasher's float switch and connections for any leaks or blockages. Running a sanitation cycle with a dishwasher-safe cleaner can remove any hidden residues affecting functionality. If these measures fail, refer to the appliance's manual for further troubleshooting steps or seek professional service.</li>

                            <p><strong>Question:</strong> I have leftover cooked polenta that's hardened in the fridge; how can I transform it into a new, appetizing dish?</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>a)To repurpose leftover hardened polenta into a delicious dish, consider mashing it and forming it into balls for baking. Start by mashing the polenta 
                                    until smooth, adding a bit of milk if necessary to achieve the right consistency. Form the mixture into small balls and place them on a baking tray 
                                    lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated oven at 375Â°F for about 15-20 minutes, turning halfway through, until they are firm and lightly browned.
                                     Serve the baked polenta balls with a tangy salsa or as part of a breakfast platter with eggs and bacon
                                     (Incorrect)</li>
                                <li>b) A unique approach to revamp leftover hardened polenta is by slicing it into fingers and grilling them. Slice the polenta into 1/2-inch thick fingers.
                                    Preheat a grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. Place the polenta fingers on the grill and cook them for about 3-4 minutes on each side
                                    until they have grill marks and are heated through. Serve the grilled polenta fingers with a drizzle of balsamic reduction or alongside a fresh salad. 
                                   Alternatively, you can crumble the grilled polenta over a soup for an added crunchy texture. (Incorrect)</li>
                                <li class="correct" >c)One creative method to transform leftover hardened polenta into a new dish is by cutting it into cubes 
                                    and deep-frying them. Begin by slicing the polenta into 1/2-inch thick cubes. Heat a substantial amount 
                                    of vegetable oil in a deep fryer or pot over high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the polenta cubes and cook
                                     them for about 5-6 minutes until they are golden brown and have a crunchy exterior. Serve the fried polenta 
                                     cubes with a dip of your choice, such as spicy aioli or a creamy yogurt-based sauce, or as an 
                                    appetizer for a party. Alternatively, you can grill the cubes on a barbecue for a smoky flavor.(Answer)</li>

                            <p><strong>Question:</strong>Someone is bleeding profusely from their leg after an accident; I applied pressure but it's not stopping; should I use a tourniquet, and how?</p>

                                <li>a)Yes, in cases of excessive bleeding that does not cease with direct pressure, employing a tourniquet could be an option to manage the bleeding risk. To use a tourniquet, position it below the bleeding site, ideally 2-3 inches below the wound but avoiding placement on joints like the shoulder or wrist. Ensure it is tightened until bleeding is significantly reduced and it is secured properly. Document the exact time of application as this timing is important for healthcare workers to understand how long it has been used. A tourniquet is meant for use in dire, life-endangering situations, and it is imperative to get professional medical aid as soon as achievable.</li>
                                <li>b) Yes, when facing severe blood loss that cannot be controlled with direct pressure, using a tourniquet might be an effective method to slow down the bleeding. To deploy a tourniquet, place it below the site of the bleeding injury, ideally 2-3 inches away from the wound but not over a joint such as an ankle or wrist. Tighten the device so the bleeding slows significantly and make sure it is fastened securely. It is crucial to record the time the tourniquet was applied, as medical personnel need to be aware of the duration it has been applied. Only use a tourniquet in critical emergencies, and ensure to seek professional medical assistance without delay.</li>
                                <li>c)Yes, in situations where there is major bleeding that does not stop despite applying direct pressure, applying a tourniquet might be considered a method to attempt controlling the bleeding. To use a tourniquet, place it directly on the site of the bleeding, ideally wrapping it tightly around the wound itself. Avoid placing it on joints such as the knee or elbow, and secure it firmly. Remember to note the exact time when the tourniquet was applied, as medical staff will need this information to assess the duration it has been in place. A tourniquet should only be employed in critical, life-threatening situations, and it is crucial to contact medical professionals immediately for further assistance.</li>

Dehydration can often lead to cognitive issues and a lack of motivation, as it affects the body's ability to function optimally. Similarly, endocrine disorders can manifest in similar ways, impacting energy levels and reducing interest in activities once enjoyed. To address these concerns, it's important to first consult with an endocrinologist to accurately diagnose the underlying cause. Meanwhile, strategies to improve focus and motivation include practicing hydration habits or adjusting fluid intake, ensuring regular medical check-ups, maintaining a controlled diet, engaging in specific physical activities, and possibly considering hormonal therapy.

                                <li>The questions underwent multiple rounds of human annotation. This included generating the ground truth answers first and then creating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the ground truth. The MCQs were crafted with the <span class="highlight">following principles</span>:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Options were highly similar to the ground truth, differing only in specific keywords or subtle details to make them incorrect.</li>
                                        <li>On average, MCQs were longer than the ground truth answers to test model precision.</li>
                                        <li>Some questions included multiple correct answers for added complexity.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> The generated questions were thoroughly reviewed for similarity and uniqueness. Any redundant or overly similar questions were removed. Additionally, each batch of questions underwent sampling and human verification to ensure accuracy and relevance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluation on LLMs:</strong> The curated dataset was used to evaluate various large language models across different scales, focusing particularly on those optimized for mobile usage. Evaluation metrics included latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency to ensure the benchmarks were practical for mobile environments.</li>
