                                </div>
                                <p>Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, have limited computational resources compared to high-end servers. <span class="highlight">Apple Intelligence</span> and other mobile-focused AI frameworks prioritize optimization techniques to run small-scale large language models (LLMs) directly and efficiently on these constrained environments. Techniques like model compression, quantization, and efficient architectures (e.g., linear complexity models) are crucial for enabling LLMs to perform effectively on mobile devices. However, these models have limited capabilities.</p>

                    <ol class="methodology-list">
                        <li><strong>Field Selection:</strong> We began by conducting an in-depth search to identify fields that people frequently need or use in daily life, work, shopping, gaming, travel, or other scenarios. These fields were designed to align with mobile searches and user queries. These fields gathered from diverse sources including Wikipedia, various websites, and large language models to ensure inclusivity and relevance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Question Structuring and Human Annotation:</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Questions were categorized into two types: standard questions and challenging scenario-based questions.</li>
                                <li>The questions underwent multiple rounds of human annotation. This included generating the ground truth answers first and then creating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the ground truth. The MCQs were crafted with the following principles:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Options were highly similar to the ground truth, differing only in specific keywords or subtle details to make them incorrect.</li>
                                        <li>On average, MCQs were longer than the ground truth answers to test model precision.</li>
                                        <li>Some questions included multiple correct answers for added complexity.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> The generated questions were thoroughly reviewed for similarity and uniqueness. Any redundant or overly similar questions were removed. Additionally, each batch of questions underwent sampling and human verification to ensure accuracy and relevance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluation on LLMs:</strong> The curated dataset was used to evaluate various large language models across different scales, focusing particularly on those optimized for mobile usage. Evaluation metrics included latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency to ensure the benchmarks were practical for mobile environments.</li>
