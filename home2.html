                            <h5>Hard</h5>
                            <p><strong>Question:</strong> I have leftover cooked polenta that's hardened in the fridge; how can I transform it into a new, appetizing dish?</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>a)To repurpose leftover hardened polenta into a delicious dish, consider mashing it and forming it into balls for baking. Start by mashing the polenta 
                                    until smooth, adding a bit of milk if necessary to achieve the right consistency. Form the mixture into small balls and place them on a baking tray 
                                    lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated oven at 375Â°F for about 15-20 minutes, turning halfway through, until they are firm and lightly browned.
                                     Serve the baked polenta balls with a tangy salsa or as part of a breakfast platter with eggs and bacon
                                     (Incorrect)</li>
                                <li>b) A unique approach to revamp leftover hardened polenta is by slicing it into fingers and grilling them. Slice the polenta into 1/2-inch thick fingers.
                                    Preheat a grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. Place the polenta fingers on the grill and cook them for about 3-4 minutes on each side
                                    until they have grill marks and are heated through. Serve the grilled polenta fingers with a drizzle of balsamic reduction or alongside a fresh salad. 
                                   Alternatively, you can crumble the grilled polenta over a soup for an added crunchy texture. (Incorrect)</li>
                                <li class="correct" >c)One creative method to transform leftover hardened polenta into a new dish is by cutting it into cubes 
                                    and deep-frying them. Begin by slicing the polenta into 1/2-inch thick cubes. Heat a substantial amount 
                                    of vegetable oil in a deep fryer or pot over high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the polenta cubes and cook
                                     them for about 5-6 minutes until they are golden brown and have a crunchy exterior. Serve the fried polenta 
                                     cubes with a dip of your choice, such as spicy aioli or a creamy yogurt-based sauce, or as an 
                                    appetizer for a party. Alternatively, you can grill the cubes on a barbecue for a smoky flavor.(Answer)</li>

                                <li>Questions were categorized into two types: standard questions and challenging scenario-based questions.</li>
                                <li>The questions underwent multiple rounds of human annotation. This included generating the ground truth answers first and then creating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the ground truth. The MCQs were crafted with the following principles:

                                        <li>Options were highly similar to the ground truth, differing only in specific keywords or subtle details to make them incorrect.</li>
                                        <li>On average, MCQs were longer than the ground truth answers to test model precision.</li>

                        <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> The generated questions were thoroughly reviewed for similarity and uniqueness. Any redundant or overly similar questions were removed. Additionally, each batch of questions underwent sampling and human verification to ensure accuracy and relevance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluation on LLMs:</strong> The curated dataset was used to evaluate various large language models across different scales, focusing particularly on those optimized for mobile usage.
